# TwinGalaxies_Thread_Analysis
Jupyter notebook with analysis done on dataset based on the Billy Mitchell Donkey Kong dispute thread: https://www.twingalaxies.com/showthread.php/176004-Dispute-Jeremy-Young-Arcade-Donkey-Kong-Points-Hammer-Allowed-Player-Billy-L-Mitchell-Score-1-062-800/

- Network statistics (poster score, post score, ...) are not well developped and should be re-evaluated with a theoretical analysis. 
- Comments and proper refactoring is missing
